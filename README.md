# Metal By Example Swift 4

This code is me going along with the Metal Example book but with swift 4.

The original code by the author can be found [here](https://github.com/metal-by-example/sample-code)

I am mostly focusing on learning the graphics concepts in the book so my code design may be poor. Please let me know if you have any suggested improvements!

# Setup
1. Create a single view swift application
2. Create a new CocoaTouch file that inherits from UIView
3. Go to your storyboard and attach the only view to the cocoa touch file you just created
